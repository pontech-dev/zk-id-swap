## How It's made

ZK ID Swap combines cutting-edge technologies to create a secure and efficient SNS account trading marketplace. Hereâ€™s how we built it:

**zkTLS Integration (webProof by [vlayer](https://www.vlayer.xyz/)):**

We implemented zkTLS technology to securely verify SNS account ownership. This allows smart contracts to validate Twitter IDs directly, ensuring transparent and trustless transactions.

**[Push Protocol Chat]((https://push.org/)):**

A secure chat feature built with Push Protocol enables users to exchange credentials like IDs and passwords without exposing them to intermediaries, preserving privacy.

**[Web3Auth](https://web3auth.io/) for Wallet Integration:**

Web3Auth simplifies onboarding for non-crypto users by providing an easy-to-use wallet solution, bridging the gap between web2 and web3.

**[USDC](https://www.circle.com/usdc) as the Transaction Currency:**

By adopting USDC, we ensure stable, reliable transactions that are familiar to crypto and non-crypto users alike.

**[MoonPay](https://www.moonpay.com/) as an Onramp Solution:**

Users who have completed KYC through MoonPay can purchase USDC via credit card.

**[World ID]((https://ja-jp.world.org/world-id)) for Humanity Verification:**

World ID adds an additional layer of security by verifying users' humanity, discouraging malicious behavior and building trust within the ecosystem.
